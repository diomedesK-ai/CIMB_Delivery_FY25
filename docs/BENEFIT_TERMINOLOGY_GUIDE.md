## Why This Matters

### ❌ **Incorrect** (Before)
"Everyday AI Productivity → **Net Profit**: $123M"
- **Problem**: Productivity tools don't generate profit; they save costs
- **Confusing**: Makes it sound like revenue-generating

### ✅ **Correct** (After)
"Everyday AI Productivity → **Cost Savings**: $123M"
- **Accurate**: Reflects labor cost reduction + time savings
- **Clear**: Audience understands this is efficiency, not revenue

## Forrester Alignment

All benefit calculations follow **Forrester's Total Economic Impact (TEI)** methodology:

**Formula**:
```
Economic Benefits = Investment × (ROI% / 100)
Value Label Amount = Economic Benefits - Investment
```

**Breakdown** (Forrester standard):
- **Labor Savings** (40%): FTE reduction or redeployment
- **Productivity Gains** (30%): Time saved, throughput increase
- **Error Reduction** (20%): Quality improvement, less rework
- **Risk/Compliance** (10%): Risk mitigation, compliance benefits

**Category Adjustments**:
- **Risk Intelligence**: Higher fraud prevention weight (45%)
- **Compliance**: Higher fine avoidance weight (40%)
- **Campaign Automation**: Higher revenue weight (50%)
- **RM Tools**: Higher sales effectiveness weight (40%)

## Key Principles

1. **Accuracy First**: Use terminology that accurately describes the benefit
2. **No Misleading Labels**: Don't call cost savings "profit" or efficiency "revenue"
3. **Business Credibility**: CFOs and finance teams will scrutinize labels
4. **Forrester Aligned**: Stay consistent with industry-standard methodology
5. **Clear Communication**: Stakeholders should immediately understand the value type

- **Investment**: $2.76M
- **ROI**: 120%
- **Economic Benefits**: $3.31M
- **Value**: $3.31M - $2.76M = **$550k**
- **Label**: **"Cost Savings: $550k"**
- **Explanation**: "Labor cost reduction + time savings"

### Example 2: Fraud Detection System
- **Investment**: $2.54M
- **ROI**: 450%
- **Economic Benefits**: $11.43M
- **Value**: $11.43M - $2.54M = **$8.89M**

- **Label**: **"Revenue Impact: $2.88M"**
- **Explanation**: "Campaign revenue + marketing efficiency"

## Validation Checklist

When reviewing benefit labels, ask:

1. ✅ **Is this label accurate?** Does it reflect the actual benefit type?
2. ✅ **Would a CFO approve?** Is it financially credible?
3. ✅ **Is it clear?** Would stakeholders understand what it means?
4. ✅ **Is it consistent?** Does it match Forrester methodology?
5. ✅ **Is it defensible?** Can we explain and justify the label?
