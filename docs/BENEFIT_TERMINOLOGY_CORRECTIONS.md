## Investment Review & Corrections

### Investment Calculation Updates

**OLD Logic** (Too Aggressive):
- Users: 500-5000 per use case
- ACR: $25k-150k/month
- Result: **$70M** for Everyday AI Productivity

**NEW Logic** (Conservative, Realistic):
- Users: 100-2000 per use case (phase 1 scale)
- ACR: $3k-80k/month (pilot to full scale)
- Implementation: $250-400/user or 1.5-3× monthly ACR
- Result: **~$20M** for Everyday AI Productivity

**Key Changes**:
1. **Enterprise M365 Copilot**: 5000 → 2000 users (phased rollout)
2. **Department pilots**: 500 → 100-150 users (realistic team sizes)
3. **ACR defaults**: $25k-50k → $8k-12k/month (conservative pilot scale)
4. **Implementation costs**: More realistic based on complexity
