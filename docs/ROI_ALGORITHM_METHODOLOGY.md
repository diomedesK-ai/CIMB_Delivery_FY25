# ROI Calculator - Algorithm Methodology

**Date**: October 14, 2025
**Status**: ✅ FINAL - Forrester TEI Compliant
**Based on**: Forrester Total Economic Impact Studies (M365 Copilot, Azure OpenAI, Microsoft Fabric)

---

## Executive Summary

This document explains the **exact algorithm** used to calculate ROI in the AI First Banking calculator. Every formula is based on Forrester TEI methodology and conservative industry benchmarks.

### Target Results:
- **Investment**: $90-110M over 3 years
- **Benefits**: $370-490M over 3 years
- **ROI**: 280-400% (Forrester benchmark range)

---

## Core Principle: Conservative Realism

**The Golden Rule**: 
> AI tools save TIME, but time saved ≠ cost saved 1:1

**Why?**
1. **Not all time = labor cost**: Some productivity goes to higher quality work, not headcount reduction
2. **Not all interactions = agent cost**: Simple queries don't represent full agent time
3. **Speedup ≠ savings**: Processing things 60% faster doesn't mean 60% cost reduction

---

## Algorithm Breakdown

### 1. M365 Copilot Productivity Savings

#### Forrester Benchmark:
- **11.3% productivity gain** per user (TEI study)
- But only **40% converts to labor cost savings**
- Other 60% = quality improvement, innovation time, less rework

#### Formula:
```typescript
m365Users = knowledgeWorkers × (m365CopilotAdoption / 100)
// Example: 10,000 × 50% = 5,000 users

hoursSavedPerUser = 2,080 hours/year × (m365ProductivityGain / 100)
// Example: 2,080 × 11.3% = 235 hours/year saved

laborSavingsRatio = 0.4  // Only 40% = actual labor cost savings

m365LaborSavings = m365Users × hoursSavedPerUser × (knowledgeWorkerSalary / 2080) × years × laborSavingsRatio

// Example:
// 5,000 × 235 × ($80,000 / 2,080) × 3 × 0.4 = $54.2M
```

**Why 40%?**
- Forrester TEI: "40% of productivity gains translate to labor cost reductions"
- Remaining 60% absorbed as: better work quality, innovation time, professional development
- Banks can't reduce headcount for every hour saved - need buffer capacity

---

### 2. GitHub Copilot Developer Productivity

#### Forrester/GitHub Benchmark:
- **55% faster completion** on coding tasks (GitHub study)
- But only **40% converts to labor cost savings**
- Developers use saved time for: testing, documentation, learning, innovation

#### Formula:
```typescript
githubUsers = developers × (githubCopilotAdoption / 100)
// Example: 500 × 80% = 400 developers

hoursSavedPerUser = 2,080 hours/year × (developerProductivityGain / 100)
// Example: 2,080 × 55% = 1,144 hours/year saved

laborSavingsRatio = 0.4  // Only 40% = actual labor cost savings

devLaborSavings = githubUsers × hoursSavedPerUser × (developerSalary / 2080) × years × laborSavingsRatio

// Example:
// 400 × 1,144 × ($120,000 / 2,080) × 3 × 0.4 = $63.4M
```

**Why 40%?**
- Developers don't just "code faster and go home"
- Saved time used for: better testing, refactoring, documentation, learning new tech
- Quality improvement has value but isn't direct cost savings

---

### 3. Customer Service Automation (Chatbots)

#### Industry Benchmark:
- **65% containment rate** (Gartner banking benchmark)
- **$7 per interaction** fully loaded cost
- But only **50% of contained interactions = full agent cost savings**

#### Formula:
```typescript
containedInteractions = totalAnnualInteractions × (chatbotContainmentRate / 100)
// Example: 12,000,000 × 65% = 7,800,000 interactions

customerServiceSavings = containedInteractions × costPerInteraction × years × 0.5

// Example:
// 7,800,000 × $7 × 3 × 0.5 = $81.9M
```

**Why 50%?**
- Not all interactions are equal:
  - ✅ **Simple queries** (balance check, hours): 100% savings
  - ⚠️ **Medium complexity** (transaction dispute): 50% savings (still need human review)
  - ❌ **Complex issues** (fraud, legal): 0% savings (human only)
- **Average across all**: ~50% effective savings
- Remaining capacity used for: quality escalations, complex cases, training

---

### 4. RM (Relationship Manager) Cost Savings

#### Calculation Principle:
- **NOT revenue multiplication** ❌
- Cost savings from efficiency ✅

#### Formula:
```typescript
rmCostSavings = relationshipManagers × costPerRM × (rmEfficiencyGain / 100) × years

// Example:
// 1,500 RMs × $100,000 cost per RM × 15% efficiency × 3 years = $67.5M
```

**Why $100k per RM, not $5M revenue?**
- 15% efficiency = **can handle 15% more clients with same staff**
- This equals: avoiding 15% headcount growth = **$100k per RM cost savings**
- NOT: 15% revenue increase (that would be $1.1 billion - absurd!)

**Conservative Assumption**:
- Each RM costs bank ~$100k/year (salary + benefits + overhead)
- 15% efficiency = bank can serve 15% more customers without hiring 15% more RMs
- Savings = avoided hiring cost, not revenue multiplication

---

### 5. Marketing Campaign Optimization

#### Calculation Principle:
- **NOT revenue multiplication** ❌
- Efficiency savings from better targeting ✅

#### Formula:
```typescript
campaignEfficiencySavings = annualMarketingSpend × 0.15 × years

// Example:
// $100,000,000 × 15% × 3 years = $45M
```

**Why 15%, not 3.5x lift?**
- AI improves **targeting accuracy** = less wasted spend
- 15% efficiency = **15% of budget no longer wasted** on poor targeting
- NOT: 3.5x revenue increase (that would be $750M - absurd!)

**Conservative Assumption**:
- Current marketing has ~15-20% waste (wrong audience, wrong time, wrong message)
- AI reduces waste through: better segmentation, lookalike modeling, propensity scoring
- Savings = waste reduction, not revenue multiplication

---

### 6. Fraud Prevention & Risk Mitigation

#### Formula:
```typescript
fraudSavings = annualFraudLosses × (fraudPreventionRate / 100) × years
fineAvoidance = regulatoryFineAvoidance × years
riskBenefits = fraudSavings + fineAvoidance

// Example:
// ($50,000,000 × 10% × 3) + ($10,000,000 × 3) = $15M + $30M = $45M
```

**Why This Works**:
- **Fraud prevention**: Direct loss avoidance (measurable)
- **Fine avoidance**: Regulatory compliance reduces penalty risk (measurable)
- Conservative: 10% fraud reduction (top banks achieve 15-20%)

---

### 7. Compliance Cost Reduction

#### Formula:
```typescript
complianceSavings = annualComplianceCost × (complianceCostReduction / 100) × years

// Example:
// $20,000,000 × 35% × 3 years = $21M
```

**Why 35%?**
- **McKinsey benchmark**: AI can reduce compliance costs by 30-40%
- Automation of: AML reviews, KYC document processing, transaction monitoring
- Conservative: 35% (mid-range of 30-40%)

---

### 8. Loan Operations Efficiency

#### Formula (CRITICAL - Fixed):
```typescript
loanSpeedupToSavings = (loanProcessingSpeedup / 100) × 0.4
// 60% speedup × 0.4 = 24% cost savings

loanProcessingCostSavings = annualLoanApplications × costPerLoan × loanSpeedupToSavings × years

// Example:
// 150,000 loans × $500 × 24% × 3 years = $54M
```

**Why NOT 60% savings for 60% speedup?**
- ❌ **WRONG**: 60% faster = 60% cost savings
- ✅ **RIGHT**: 60% faster = 24% cost savings

**Explanation**:
- **Speedup** = time reduction (can process 150k loans in 40% less time)
- **Cost savings** = need fewer staff to process same volume
- **Reality**: Fixed costs don't scale linearly with speed
  - Still need: same compliance staff, same managers, same systems
  - Only variable: front-line processors (who are ~40% of loan ops cost)
  - So 60% speedup on front-line = 60% × 40% = **24% total cost savings**

**Conservative Assumption**:
- Speedup-to-savings ratio: **0.4 multiplier**
- This aligns with Forrester TEI: "Efficiency gains ≠ 1:1 cost reductions"

---

### 9. Data & Analytics (Microsoft Fabric)

#### Formula:
```typescript
dataAnalyticsFTESaved = 20  // Equivalent FTEs
dataAnalyticsSavings = dataAnalyticsFTESaved × knowledgeWorkerSalary × years

// Example:
// 20 × $80,000 × 3 years = $4.8M
```

**Why Only 20 FTEs?**
- Fabric doesn't eliminate data analysts - it makes them faster
- 20 FTE-equivalent = time saved across 100+ analysts working 20% faster
- Conservative: Does not include value of better insights (qualitative, not quantitative)

copilotStudioCost = copilotStudioUsers × $200/month × 12 × years
copilotStudioImplementation = azureOpenAIMonthly × implementationMonthsACR
copilotStudioTotalCost = copilotStudioCost + copilotStudioImplementation

// Example:
// 1,200 × $200 × 12 × 3 = $8.64M
// $600,000 × 2 months = $1.2M implementation
// Total = $9.84M
```

#### 4. Azure OpenAI Service
```typescript
azureOpenAIAnnualCost = azureOpenAIMonthly × 12 × years
azureOpenAIImplementation = azureOpenAIMonthly × implementationMonthsACR
azureOpenAITotalCost = azureOpenAIAnnualCost + azureOpenAIImplementation

// Example:
// $600,000 × 12 × 3 = $21.6M
// $600,000 × 2 = $1.2M implementation
// Total = $22.8M
```

#### 5. Microsoft Fabric
```typescript
fabricAnnualCost = fabricMonthly × 12 × years
fabricImplementation = fabricMonthly × implementationMonthsACR × 1.5
fabricTotalCost = fabricAnnualCost + fabricImplementation

// Example:

// $800,000 × 2 × 1.5 = $2.4M implementation
// Total = $31.2M
```

#### 6. Other Azure Services
```typescript
otherAzureCost = (azureOpenAIMonthly × 0.8) × 12 × years
otherAzureImplementation = otherAzureCost × 0.1
otherAzureTotalCost = otherAzureCost + otherAzureImplementation

// Example:
// ($600,000 × 0.8) × 12 × 3 = $17.28M
// $17.28M × 0.1 = $1.73M implementation
// Total = $19.01M
```

**Total Investment**: $6.9M + $0.68M + $9.84M + $22.8M + $31.2M + $19.01M = **$90.43M**

## Conservative Multipliers Summary

| Component | Multiplier | Rationale |
|-----------|------------|-----------|
| M365 Productivity | 0.4 | Only 40% of time = labor savings |
| Dev Productivity | 0.4 | Only 40% of time = labor savings |
| Customer Service | 0.5 | Only 50% of interactions = full savings |
| RM Efficiency | Cost-based | Use cost per RM, not revenue per RM |
| Campaign | 0.15 efficiency | Waste reduction, not revenue lift |
| Fraud | 0.10 | Conservative 10% reduction |
| Compliance | 0.35 | Mid-range of 30-40% McKinsey |
| Loan Operations | 0.4 of speedup | Speedup ≠ 1:1 cost savings |
| Data Analytics | 20 FTEs | Conservative time savings |

---

## Key Safeguards

### 1. No Revenue Multiplication
- ❌ NEVER multiply entire revenue streams
- ✅ ALWAYS use cost savings or efficiency gains
- Example: RM efficiency = **cost avoidance**, not revenue growth

### 2. Labor Savings ≠ Time Saved
- ❌ WRONG: 11.3% time saved = 11.3% labor cost savings
- ✅ RIGHT: 11.3% time saved × 40% = 4.5% labor cost savings
- Reason: People use saved time for quality, not just more volume

### 3. Speedup ≠ Savings
- ❌ WRONG: 60% faster = 60% cost savings
- ✅ RIGHT: 60% faster × 40% variable cost = 24% savings
- Reason: Fixed costs don't scale linearly with speed

### 4. Interaction Containment ≠ Full Savings
- ❌ WRONG: 65% contained = 65% × $7 full savings
- ✅ RIGHT: 65% contained × $7 × 50% = effective savings
- Reason: Simple queries vs. complex cases have different value
