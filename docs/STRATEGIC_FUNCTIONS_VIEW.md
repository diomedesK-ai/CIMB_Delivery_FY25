## Key Metrics

### Per Function:
1. **Weighted ROI**: Aggregate ROI across all use cases in the function
   - Formula: `(Total Return / Total Investment - 1) × 100`
   - Reflects actual investment-weighted performance

2. **Use Case Count**: Number of use cases in the function
   - Shows depth of capability

3. **Total Investment**: Sum of all use case investments (3-year TCO)
   - License costs + ACR costs + Implementation

4. **Economic Benefits**: Sum of all returns across use cases
   - Investment × (ROI% / 100)

5. **Total Value**: Economic Benefits - Total Investment
   - Net value created by the function

### Aggregate (All Functions):
- Total number of functions
- Total use cases across all functions
- Total portfolio value

## Use Cases

### Executive Presentation
**Scenario**: C-suite presentation on AI strategy

**Flow**:
1. Navigate to **Strategic Functions**
2. Show overview: "9 strategic functions, 136 use cases, $XXM total value"
3. Walk through each function card
4. Click on a function to drill into specific use cases
5. Show aggregated ROI and business value

**Benefit**: Clear, executive-friendly view of AI portfolio

---

### Budget Planning
**Scenario**: Finance team needs investment breakdown by function

**Flow**:
1. Review each function card
2. Note investment amounts
3. Click to see use case detail
4. Plan phased rollout by function

**Benefit**: Function-level investment planning

---

### Strategic Prioritization
**Scenario**: Deciding which functions to prioritize

**Flow**:
1. Compare weighted ROI across functions
2. Look at use case count (complexity)
3. Review total value potential
4. Click for detailed use case lists

**Decision Criteria**:
- Highest ROI functions

---

## Design Principles

### 1. **Numbered Functions**
- Clear, memorable identifiers (0-8)
- Follows image style with circular numbers

### 2. **Aggregated Metrics**
- True weighted ROI (not simple average)
- Investment-weighted calculations
- Forrester-aligned methodology

### 3. **Connected Use Cases**
- Click to drill down
- See all use cases in a function
- Individual metrics preserved

### 4. **Clean, Executive Design**
- Card-based layout
- Key metrics prominently displayed
- Minimal clutter
- Professional aesthetic

## Navigation

**Access**: 
- Sidebar → **Strategic Functions**
- Direct URL: `/functions`

**From Strategic Functions**:
- Click any function card → See detailed use cases
- Navigate to other views via sidebar

## Technical Implementation

### Data Aggregation
```typescript
// Weighted ROI calculation
const totalInvestment = sum(useCases.map(uc => calculateInvestment(uc)))
const totalReturn = sum(useCases.map(uc => investment * (roi / 100)))
const weightedROI = ((totalReturn / totalInvestment) - 1) * 100
```

### Function Mapping
- Functions are mapped from existing categories
- No new data required
- Uses existing use case data
- Dynamic calculation of all metrics

### Real-Time Updates
