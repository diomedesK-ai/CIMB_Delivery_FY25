## Four Main Tabs

### 1. **Assumptions Tab** - Configurable Levers

This is where you adjust all assumptions to customize the ROI model for different scenarios.

#### User Base & Adoption

**Configurable Parameters**:
- **Knowledge Workers**: 1,000 - 20,000 (default: 10,000)
- **Developers**: 100 - 2,000 (default: 500)
- **Contact Center Agents**: 500 - 5,000 (default: 2,000)
- **Relationship Managers**: 500 - 3,000 (default: 1,500)
- **M365 Copilot Adoption**: 10-100% (default: 20% = 2,000 users)
- **GitHub Copilot Adoption**: 10-100% (default: 80% = 400 developers)

**Why These Matter**:
- M365 Copilot at 20% adoption = **Conservative Phase 1 rollout**
- Can scale to 100% to see full enterprise impact
- User counts drive license costs and labor savings

#### Productivity & Benefits

**Forrester-Based Defaults**:
- **M365 Productivity Gain**: 11.3% (Forrester TEI baseline)
- **Developer Productivity Gain**: 55% (GitHub Copilot study)
- **Chatbot Containment Rate**: 65% (Industry standard: 60-70%)
- **RM Efficiency Gain**: 15% (Conservative estimate)
- **Fraud Prevention Rate**: 10% (Reduces $50M annual losses by 10% = $5M/year)
- **Compliance Cost Reduction**: 35% (Reduces $20M annual cost by 35% = $7M/year)

**Sensitivity**:
- Increasing M365 productivity from 11.3% to 15% adds **$20M+ in benefits**
- Increasing chatbot containment from 65% to 75% adds **$8M+ in savings**
- These levers allow you to model different implementation quality scenarios

#### Costs & Pricing

**License Costs** (Per User/Month):
- M365 Copilot: $30 (Microsoft list price)
- GitHub Copilot Business: $39 (Microsoft list price)
- Copilot Studio: $200/agent (approximate for banking chatbots)

**Azure Consumption (ACR)** (Monthly):
- Azure OpenAI: $25,000/month (default for pilot/initial rollout)
  - Can range from $10k (pilot) to $100k (full enterprise)
- Microsoft Fabric: $50,000/month (data platform)
  - Can range from $20k (starter) to $150k (full deployment)

**Implementation**:
- Per-User Implementation: $300 (training, onboarding, change mgmt)
- ACR Implementation: 2 months of ACR spend

**Why These Matter**:
- ACR is the largest cost driver (~50% of total investment)
- Adjusting Azure OpenAI from $25k to $50k/month doubles that portion of investment
- Implementation costs are one-time in Year 1

#### Economic Values

**Salary Assumptions**:
- Knowledge Worker: $80,000 fully loaded
- Developer: $120,000 fully loaded
- Contact Center Cost: $7/interaction

**Business Values**:
- Annual Fraud Losses: $50M (industry benchmark for mid-size bank)
- Annual Compliance Cost: $20M
- Regulatory Fine Avoidance: $10M/year
- RM Revenue Per User: $5M/year
- Annual Marketing Spend: $100M

**Why These Matter**:
- Salary assumptions drive labor savings calculations
- Fraud/compliance values drive risk mitigation ROI
- Higher values = higher benefits, but must be realistic for CIMB

- GitHub Copilot cost ($39 vs. $30 for M365)
- Implementation cost per user ($300 ± $100)

---

## FAQ for Executives

### Q1: Is $127M investment realistic?

**A**: Yes. This is ~$42M/year for enterprise AI transformation across 15,000 staff. Comparable investments:
- DBS: $200M+ annual tech spend
- JPMorgan: $12B annual tech spend ($300M would be 2.5% of that)
- CIMB scale: $42M/year = 0.5-1% of annual operating expenses (typical for digital transformation)

---

### Q2: How do we know $424M in benefits is real?

**A**: Forrester TEI methodology validates it:
1. **Labor Savings (40%)**: 2,000 users × 11.3% productivity × $80k salary × 3 years = **$54M** (just M365)
2. **Contact Center (20%)**: 7.8M interactions deflected × $7/interaction × 3 years = **$164M**
3. **Fraud Prevention (10%)**: $5M/year × 3 years = **$15M**
4. **Compliance (5%)**: $7M/year × 3 years = **$21M**
5. **RM Revenue (15%)**: $11M/year × 3 years = **$34M**
6. **Loan Ops (10%)**: $45M/year × 3 years = **$135M**
7. **Total**: **$423M** ✅

Each component is independently verifiable.

---

### Q3: What if we don't hit these numbers?

**A**: The model is conservative:
- M365 productivity of 11.3% is Forrester **baseline** (not best-case)
- Chatbot containment of 65% is **industry average** (top performers hit 75-80%)
- Fraud prevention of 10% is **conservative** (AI fraud models routinely hit 15-20%)

Even at **50% of projected benefits** ($212M), ROI is still **67%** → still worth doing.

---

### Q4: How does this compare to competitors?

**A**: DBS (most advanced bank in Asia):
- Goal: "50% of customer interactions by AI by 2025"
- Estimated investment: $200M+
- Public ROI: Not disclosed, but massive efficiency gains reported

CIMB at $127M investment is **35% less** than DBS with similar scope.

---

### Q5: What's the biggest risk?

**A**: **Adoption and change management**, not technology.

- Technology works (Forrester validates it)
- Risk is **people don't use it** or **use it poorly**

**Mitigation**:
- Start with pilot (500-2,000 users)
- Track ROI monthly (Forrester provides tracking framework)
- Expand only if hitting targets
- Invest 20% of budget in change management
